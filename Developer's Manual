What has been done so far:
1- The search is performed mostly on the metadata of around 870000 books. A few hebrew results were added as well. A total of 400
Topics were created from this data using the LDA ALGORITHM and each topic has a total of 19 words. For each Topic a word cloud 
was created with the words sized to match their weight in that topic.
2- All the Data was stored in the database. This includes the original metadata of these books as well as the results obtained 
from the LDA Algorithm. This data is used in order to help with the search.
3- A simple search interface was added in order to test the results and decide what can things can be improved onto and how.

How is Search Performed:
Upon entering the search word, the program looks for that word in words of the topics that are stored in the database. If the 
word is not searched, an appropriate message will be displayed requesting a new word.
When the word is found within the topics in the database, it's id is then saved. Through the id, we check the topics that this 
word is related to and get the first two.
The next step is the display of the word clouds for these topics. Upon choosing a word cloud, the id of the topic (wordcloud) is 
searched and the id of the highest 7 documents that are related to that topic are being retrieved. 
In the last step, the book name is extracted from the content of the metadata for each document.

Things that can be improved and added.
1- Working on more data. Possibly adding languages such as French and Arabic while continuing to improve both the English and 
Hebrew ones.
2- With more data, it is possible to get better topics and more coherent ones. (Testing to check best number of topics).
3- Creating better word clouds.
4- Improving the Search Interface by adding more functionality to it. Possibility of searching for sentences as well as returning
more word clouds. The ability to click words within a word cloud rather than the word cloud itself.
5- Displaying the results in a better way.
